        <p>Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning; 
        it is an end. And, therefore, indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the 
        aggressor — never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten. The political 
        prisoner in his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees — not to respond to their plight, 
        not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory. 
        And in denying their humanity, we betray our own.</p>
